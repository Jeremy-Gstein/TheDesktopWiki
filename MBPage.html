      <h1>Motherboard</h1>
    <body id = MBPage>
      <h3 id = MBtxt>A motherboard is the main printed circuit board in a computer. It holds and allows all input and output devices such as the CPU, Graphics Card, Ram, USB Devices, and much more. The Motherboard is responsible for allowing communication between all devices on a computer. </h3>
    <div onmouseover="mOverUefiBios(this)" onmouseout="mOutUefiBios(this)"id = "UefiBiosJS">Unified Extensible Firmware Interface and Basic Input/Output System</div>
        <script src="ProjectJavascript/UefiBios.js"></script>
      <h3 id = BIOStxt>UEFI and BIOS are both low level software that is run when you start up your computer. They are both stored on the motherboard and used as a layer between hardware and software before the operating system takes over. Many crucial computer settings are located in the BIOS such as system time, boot order, and hardware configuration.</h3>
    <div onmouseover="mOverPOST(this)" onmouseout="mOutPOST(this)"id = "PostTestJS">Power On Self Test</div>
          <script src="ProjectJavascript/PostTest.js"></script>
      <h3 id = POSTtesttxt>When the system is powered on, the CPU Checks throughout the motherboard and verifies that the peripherals and other hardware connected to the motherboard are working order. If any hardware is not in working order or is not detected, an error message is displayed on the screen. POST works before the motherboards video card is activated and it is the first thing you will see once the video card is activated. It works before and during boot. At the end of a POST test that is successful the system unit will produce one or two short beeps. These are just to inform you that all is well. POSTcards can be inserted into a motherboard slot to allow for a unique error HEX digit to appear on it.</h3>
      <h2 id = "FormFactor">Form Factors and Sizes</h2>
      <h3 id = "FormFactortxt">Depending on what form Factor motherboard you choose, all connections and ports would be a standard layout for that particular form factor motherboard, even if the vendors are different.</h3>
      <h3 id = "FormFactortxt2">A form  Factor serves as a standard or category that can be used to ensure that there is a level of hardware compatibility between devices of similar form factor even though they may come from different manufacturers.</h3>
