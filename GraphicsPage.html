    			<h1>Graphics Card</h1>
          <h3 id = Graphicstxt> The graphics card is an expansion device used to generate the output of images to a display such as a monitor. There are two different kinds of graphics cards; dedicated and integrated.
          <h1 id = "DedicatedTitle"> Dedicated Graphics Card</h1>
          <h3 id = "Dedicatedtxt">  Dedicated graphics cards use their own memory and resources to encode and decode graphics. It provides the most efficient power for graphics and allows for the CPU and RAM to fulfill other tasks. One of the downsides of modern dedicated graphics cards is that they generate a lot of heat and modern cards can use more than 300 watts of power whilst under a heavy load.</h3>
          <h1 id = "IntegratedTitle"> Integrated Graphics Card</h1>
          <h3 id = "Integratedtxt">  Integrated graphics use the processor along with dedicated system RAM to fulfill graphical encoding and decoding. This is important to note, if a computer has 8 gigabytes of RAM installed but states 1 gigabyte is used for shared graphics memory, then the processor will only use 7GB of RAM and save the rest for graphics processing. The benefits of integrated graphics includes lower power consumption and less heat compared to dedicated cards.</h3>
