          <body id = "CoolingSystems">
          <h3 id = "CoolingSystemstxt"> Computers use different methods of keeping their components away from severe heat. Some implications of overheating include; slow loading times, failed start-ups, blue screen/computer crashes, and permanent damage to components affected. One of the most important parts of computer hygiene is making sure there is good air circulation inside the case.</h3>
          <h1 id = "AirTitle"> Air Cooling <h1>
          <h3 id = "Airtxt"> Computer Fans are among the most common cooling methods found inside a household computer. They are used to bring cool air in the front and exhale through the back. In addition to fans on the case they can also be inserted on a CPU, GPU, and power supply to provide additional cooling to those components as they generate the most heat. CPU overheating is one of the most common vulnerabilities to a computer.</h3>
          <h1 id = "WaterTitle"> Water/Liquid Cooling</h1>
          <h3 id = Watertxt> As the power of computers grew, the heat output also grew allowing for the expansion of water cooling devices to keep components cool. Whilst usually referred to as ‘water’ cooling, water in fact has nothing to do with it and instead uses a non electric conductive liquid to provide cooling directly to the components that need it. Liquid cooling can replace fans in a computer and allow for a totally silent system.</h3>
          <h1 id = "HeatsinkTitle"> Heat-Sinks</h1>
          <h3 id = "Heatsinktxt"> Heat-sinks are pieces of metal with high thermal conductivity such as aluminum or copper with metal fins to increase surface area. They are inserted on top of components with only a thin layer of thermal grease, or thermal adhesive and provide cooling through one of three methods; convection, radiation, and conduction. The most common location for heatsinks is on the motherboard components and the CPU fan.</h3>
