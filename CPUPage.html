              <h4 id = "CPU">The processor is the main component of any computing device. It’s located in the motherboard where it sits snug inside a socket(LGA,PGA,ZIF). They are made up of billions of microscopic transistors that ultimately act as the brain of the system. Each transistor represents an on/off switch. The CPU interprets ON/OFF as a language called binary which consists of 0’s and 1’s( 0 meaning off and 1 meaning on). Everything done on a computer (Including looking at this website!) Is interpreted as a 0 or a 1. Some commands need just a single 1 or 0 also known as a bit while others need terabytes (8,000,000,000,000 bits).</h4>
              <h3 id = 'cpuPara'>The Processor socket is the connector on the motherboard that uses the CPU and forms the electrical interface connection and contact with the CPU for data interface and return. The CPU socket also locks the CPU in place. The CPU socket is made of plastic and often comes with a lever or latch, and with metal contacts for each of the pins on the CPU. The CPU socket is a large connector.</h3>

Most operations of a CPU are performed by one or more of the ALU’s, which load data from input registers. Transistors are used to create logic gates and combinations of logic gates make it possible to perform arithmetic operations. The ALU receives information from the register and then performs operations on the information, the control bits encode information about what operation the ALU used to perform and the operations will either be arithmetic operations or bit wise logic operations.</h4>

The ZIF sockets lock the CPU down without force ensuring that you do not damage the CPU or socket.(usually used with PGA socket types)</h4>
