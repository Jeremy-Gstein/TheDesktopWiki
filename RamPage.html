          <h3 id = "Ramtxt"> The computer systems short termed data storage. At a basic level RAM outputs information imputed into it, That data or information is retrieved from your hard drive, storage device, or wherever it's stored for long term storage and loaded into RAM while you are working on it then returned once you are done with it. While that data is being processed or used, it's temporarily stored in RAM. RAM or Random Access Memory is the place where data resides while you are working on it or a program is using it. The process of transferring all the data back and forth from memory happens all the time in your system. The faster your system can perform these transactions, the better the overall experience is. When asked about How much memory does your system have? This is the memory that is being referred to . it’s not how large the storage or hard drive device is, it’s how much memory you have in your system. If your system has low memory, applications will take longer to retrieve and be processed and put back in memory. </h3>
          <div onmouseover="mOverDimm(this)" onmouseout="mOutDimm(this)"id = "DimmJS"> Dual Inline Memory Module</div>
            <script src="ProjectJavascript/Dimm.js"></script>
          <h3 id = "Dimmtxt"> A module that contains one or several random access memory (RAM) chips on a small circuit board with pins that connect it to the computer motherboard. Each side of the DIMM has modules on it that are not connected together. They are separate. DIMMs have a 64-bit data width which gives it the capability to transfer data from these memory modules in 64 bit data blocks at a time.</h3>
          <div onmouseover="mOverDdr(this)" onmouseout="mOutDdr(this)"id = "DdrJS"> Double Data Rate</div>
            <script src="ProjectJavascript/Ddr.js"></script>
          <h3 id= "Ddrtxt">DDR transfers data on both the rising and the following of the clock cycle or  “twice per cycle” this makes higher transfer rates possible due to its efficient and strict control of data timing and clock signals. DDR is not backward or forward compatible (in other words DDR2 won’t fit in a motherboard rated for DDR3)</h3>
